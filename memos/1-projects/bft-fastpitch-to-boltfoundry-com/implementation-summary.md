# Implementation Summary - PR #179

## Summary of Changes

**Purpose:** This PR implements Phase 2 of the Fastpitch-to-Bolt Foundry
integration, replacing mock deck data with real telemetry-generated decks in the
dashboard using Isograph patterns.

### Key Architectural Changes:

1. **Pure Isograph Pattern Implementation**
   - Replaced hardcoded mock decks with real GraphQL data
   - Implemented "resolvers all the way down" pattern - no prop passing between
     components
   - Each component fetches its own data independently

2. **New Database Relationship Methods**
   - Added `queryDecks` and `createDecksItem` methods to bfDb for handling
     .many() relationships
   - Fixed BfDeck relationship names (graders/samples instead of grader/sample)
   - Changed default DB backend from memory to SQLite for persistence

3. **New Route Architecture with Separate Entrypoints**
   - Created individual entrypoints for each major route:
     - `/pg/grade` â†’ `EntrypointGrade`
     - `/pg/analyze` â†’ `EntrypointAnalyze`
     - `/pg/chat` â†’ `EntrypointChat`
   - Established redirect chain: `/pg` â†’ `/pg/grade` â†’ `/pg/grade/decks`

4. **Component Hierarchy**
   - `Grade.tsx` â†’ selects `Organization.DecksView`
   - `DecksView.tsx` â†’ Organization field component (main view)
   - `DeckList.tsx` â†’ Organization field component (list container)
   - `DecksListItem.tsx` â†’ BfDeck field component (individual item)

5. **Telemetry Handler Updates**
   - Updated to properly create decks with correct edge roles
   - Decks now properly linked to organizations

6. **Client-Side Improvements**
   - Modified `BfIsographFragmentReader` to handle redirects in dev mode
   - Added proper edge role filtering in GraphQL queries

### Testing:

- Added comprehensive e2e test (`fastpitch-telemetry.test.e2e.ts`, 490 lines)
- Verifies telemetry creates real decks that display in dashboard
- All tests passing

### Documentation:

- Created comprehensive project documentation under
  `memos/1-projects/bft-fastpitch-to-boltfoundry-com/`
- Added Isograph patterns guide (`isograph-patterns.md`, 358 lines)
- Documented all phases of integration

### Files Changed:

- **Test Files:** 2 files (including new 490-line e2e test)
- **bfDb Changes:** 4 files (new relationship methods, schema updates)
- **boltfoundry-com App:** ~60 files (new components, entrypoints, generated
  Isograph files)
- **Documentation:** 10 new files (project phases, patterns guide, Q&A)

## Result

The PR successfully completes Phase 2 of integrating Fastpitch telemetry with
the Bolt Foundry dashboard. The main achievement is that running `bft fastpitch`
now creates real decks that appear in the dashboard, replacing the hardcoded
mock data with live telemetry-generated content using proper Isograph patterns.

## Differences from Documentation

### Status Updates Needed:

1. **README.md** - Current Status shows "ðŸ”´ Phase 1: Telemetry Visibility -
   Starting" but should be updated to "âœ… Phase 2: Dashboard Integration -
   Complete"
2. **README.md** - Success Criteria checklist should be updated:
   - [x] Fastpitch telemetry visible in dashboard (Phase 2 complete)
   - [ ] Can view individual run details (partially complete - deck detail view
         exists)
   - [ ] Can provide feedback on outputs (Phase 3 - not started)
   - [ ] Feedback influences future generations (Phase 3 - not started)

### Phase 2 Documentation Alignment:

- The Phase 2 document's implementation plan matches exactly what was
  implemented in PR #179
- All technical architecture decisions documented were followed (separate
  entrypoints, Isograph patterns, component hierarchy)
- The implementation steps listed as "Done" in the document are confirmed
  complete in the PR

### Phase 1 Completion:

- Phase 1 document shows some tasks as incomplete, but based on PR #179, Phase 1
  must be complete since Phase 2 builds on it
- The success criteria for Phase 1 should be marked as complete

### Additional Implementation Details Not in Original Docs:

#### Database Layer Changes:

- Added `queryDecks` and `createDecksItem` methods to bfDb for handling .many()
  relationships (new pattern not previously documented)
- Changed default database backend from in-memory to SQLite for persistence
- Fixed BfDeck relationship naming (graders/samples instead of grader/sample)
- Implemented proper edge role filtering in GraphQL queries
- Added relationship query methods in `relationshipMethods.ts` (40 new lines)

#### Routing Architecture Overhaul:

- Created completely separate entrypoints for each route (`EntrypointGrade`,
  `EntrypointAnalyze`, `EntrypointChat`, `EntrypointPg`)
- Established multi-level redirect chain: `/pg` â†’ `/pg/grade` â†’
  `/pg/grade/decks`
- Added `EntrypointDeckDetail` for individual deck views
- Removed the old `EntrypointEval` pattern entirely
- Modified route handling to support the new entrypoint architecture

#### Telemetry Handler Enhancements:

- Updated telemetry handler to properly create decks with correct edge roles
- Fixed organization-deck linking with proper edge metadata
- Enhanced error handling in telemetry processing

#### Developer Experience:

- Added Isograph patterns guide (358 lines) for developer reference
- Created deck detail view (`BfDeckDetailView.tsx`) with full sample display
  capability
- Implemented client-side redirect handling in `BfIsographFragmentReader` for
  dev mode compatibility
- Added comprehensive e2e test coverage (490 lines)

#### Generated Code Volume:

- ~30+ new Isograph generated files for the new component architecture
- New resolver readers, output types, param types, and normalization ASTs
- Updated `__generated__/builtRoutes.ts` with new route definitions
