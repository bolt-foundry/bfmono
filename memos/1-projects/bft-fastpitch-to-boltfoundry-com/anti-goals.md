# Anti-Goals

Things we explicitly are NOT trying to do in this project.

## Out of Scope

- Building a production-ready system (this is for internal testing)
- Automated/scheduled Fastpitch runs
- User-triggered runs from the dashboard
- Public access or customer-facing features (yet)
- Real-time telemetry updates (polling is fine)
- Complex authentication (basic access is enough for now)
- Data archival or retention policies (future concern)
- Optimizing storage for large content (future concern)
